A repository for programming assignments of CSED232 (Object Oriented Programming) on 2023 Spring at POSTECH. 

- ASSN1: In this assignment, you are told to solve some problems on numbers. In the first problem, you should implement an algorithm to convert a number from a base to another. In the second problem, you are asked to implement a decimal calculator. In the third problem finally, you are to implement a simple calculator that can calculate an expression with numbers of different bases and prints output in decimal. I got 100 points out of 100 in this assignment. 

- ASSN2: In this assignment, you are about to get familiar with the concept of classes and objects. To build a readable and maintainable code, you should declare and define tons of classes and functions in separate header and source files. Specifically, you implement a linked list in this assignment and perform operations on it, such as pivot table, sorting, and so on. I got 100 points out of 100 in this assignment. 

- ASSN3: This assignment is about implementing algorithms to create ASCII art. From now on, you are getting closer to the notion of object-oriented programming. You are asked to implement a class hierarchy to create ASCII art. A skeleton code is given, so all you have to do is just fill in the blank. I also implemented an additional feature that draw an ASCII art only with numbers. I got 100 points out of 100 in this assignment. 

- ASSN4: From now on, you are getting closer to STL. In this assignment, you are asked to implement std::shared_ptr by yourself given a skeleton code. Furthermore, you should be able to manage memory of pixels of image using your shared pointer class, which means your shared pointer class should be able to be used with template. I got 100 points out of 100 in this assignment. 

- ASSN5: This is the final assignment. It is about implementing a simple game using Qt. Also, source header separation is required. As instruction, you are asked to implement 2048 game which can be played [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/2048.html). In Windows, there might be an issue with the focus of keyboard, which means you need to click on the game board before pressing any key. In my environment (macOS), it works fine so that I did not get any point deduction. However, there also are some issues with score showing. The displayed score is sometimes different from the actual score by 1 and the displayed score on the game over dialog is different. These unfixed issue (*I bet that it is due to the environment difference*) caused me to get 90 points out of 100 in this assignment.
